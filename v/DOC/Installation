Requirements
------------
Operation system: Linux
Additional packages: python/tkinter (i.e 'yum install tkinter' on Linux)
If ltuproxy required (i.e. ALICE DAQ), SMI and DIM installation required
as well as DAQ-logbook and infoLogger.

Private installation $HOME:
--------------------------
Create directory (let's call it v), and unpack tar file in it:
cd v
tar -xvf../vmebltu.tar

Edit following 3 files:
v/scripts/vmebse.bash -lines setting:
  vdir         where LTU sw will be installed
  VMEDRIVER    VMERCC (Atlas VME driver, Linux)
  VMEINCS,VMELIBS -where include fiels and libraries for VMEDRIVER are placed
  VMEWORKDIR   working directory (default: $HOME/v/vme).

  For ltuproxy following has to be set also:
  DIMDIR, SMIDIR -you need to install DIM and SMI packages, if you want to
                  use ltuproxy software together with ECS and ltudim
                  client. 
  DIM_DNS_NODE where DIM name server is running

vme/CFG/ltu/ltuttc.cfg -a template can be found in ltuttc.cfgall 

vme/CFG/ctp/DB/ttcparts.cfg  -specify:
 -detector name (the same as used in ACR with 
   command 'vmecrate detector_name'), 
 -the name of the computer where ltu_proxy will be started and 
 -the base address of your LTU board

By default, base addresses of LTU is 0x810000. This default
can be changed by modifying first '/*BOARD ...' line in source file 
v/vme/ltu/ltu.c before compile/link.
Modify base address: 0x81x000, where x is setting of 
the dial switch on your LTU board. 

The line '/*BOARD name base */' has to be the first line in the file, and
only base address can be modified (i.e. /* BOARD... is incorrect because
of space after /* ).

Compilation/link
----------------
Set environment:
. v/scripts/vmebse.bash
and compile/link:
v/scripts/distrib make

Start without ECS:
-----------------
If ltuproxy is not used in this case.
vmecrate ltu              -start ltu software, LTU board is initialised
vmecrate nbi ltu          -start ltu software, LTU board is NOT initialised
vmecrate ltu=0x812000     -working with LTU with base 0x812000 (dial set to 2)

When starting software first time after power up, LTU FPGA is loaded
from on-board flash memory. Unloaded LTU FPGA is indicated by 
the front panel LEDs -they all just dim.

TTCinit button in ->Configuration submenu has to be always pressed
after:
- powering up the crate
- disconnecting/connecting optical fibre between TTCex and your front-end

Starting with ECS:
-----------------
ltuproxy has to be started first.

ltuproxy detector_name start
ltuproxy started without parameters gives short help.

See v/detector_name/WORK/*.log files.
LTU control software should be started now by command:
vmecrate detector_name
- this starts DIM client which connects to running ltuproxy.

Note about shared memory:
ltuproxy allocates, with first start, shared memory. LTU parameters placed
in this memory, are persistent -i.e. they stay the same even if ltuproxy
is restarted. These parameters:
- are loaded to shared memory from file v/detector_name/CFG/ltu/ltuttc.cfg
- can be modified (in shared memory) in 'Defaults editor' accessed
  through: Configuration -> Defaults editor

LTU FPGA firmware upgrade
-------------------------
Last version of the firmware is b5 (shown after the ltu software start).
This version (or higher) is used in all LTUs installed in experiment area.
Firmware files are placed in v/vme/CFG/ltu/*.rbf.

There is a link to current firmware file in $VMEWORK directory, i.e.:
FlashMem.cfg -> CFG/ltu/ltu_b5.rbf
The upgrade to the newest version is done by typing:

v/vme/scripts/loadLTUfpga ltu_b5.rbf 0x81x000

This script will create FlashMem.cfg link and loads the firmware
to LTU flash memory.

Wiring of the TTC partition (versions b0 and higher):
------------------------------------------------------

 LTU                            TTCex     wire
board                           board
