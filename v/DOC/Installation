Requirements
------------
Operation system: Linux
Additional packages: python/tkinter (i.e 'yum install tkinter' on Linux)

Installation (Unix)
--------------------
Create directory (let's call it v), and unpack tar file in it:
cd v
tar -xvf../vmebltu.tar

Edit following files:
v/scripts/vmebse.bash -setting of 3 environment variables:
  VMEDRIVER -VMERCC (Atlas vme driver, Linux)
  VMECFDIR= ...v/vme   -specific software (ttcvi, ltu,...)
  VMEBDIR= ...v/vmeb   -common software (for any vme board)
  VMEWORKDIR= ...v/vme -working directory (temporary and config files)
  DIMDIR, SMIDIR -you need to install DIM and SMI packages, if you want to
                  use ltuproxy software together with ECS and ltudim
                  client. 

v/vmeb/vmeai.make.$VMEDRIVER   -link and include directories for VME driver

vme/CFG/ltu/ltuttc.cfg -a template can be found in ltuttc.cfgall 

vme/CFG/ctp/DB/ttcparts.cfg  -specify:
 -detector name (the same as used in ACR with 
   command 'vmecrate detector_name'), 
 -the name of the computer where ltu_proxy will be started and 
 -the base address of your LTU board

By default, base addresses of LTU is 0x810000. This default
can be changed by modifying /*BOARD ... lines in source file 
v/vme/ltu/ltu.c before compile/link.
Modify BASE address: 0x81x000, where x is setting of 
the dial switch on your LTU board. 

The line '/*BOARD name base */' has to be the first line in the file, and
only base address can be modified (i.e. /* BOARD... is incorrect because
of space after /* ).

Compilation/link
----------------
Set environment:
. v/scripts/vmebse.bash
and compile/link:
v/scripts/distrib make

Start without ECS:
-----------------
If ltuproxy is not used in this case.
vmecrate ltu              -start ltu software, LTU board is initialised
vmecrate nbi ltu          -start ltu software, LTU board is NOT initialised
vmecrate ltu=0x812000     -working with LTU with base 0x812000 (dial set to 2)

When starting software first time after power up, LTU FPGA is loaded
from on-board flash memory (unloaded LTU FPGA is indicated by 
dimming front panel LEDs).

There is TTCinit button in ->Configuration submenu. It has to be always
executed after:
- powering up the crate
- disconnecting fibre between TTCex and your front-end

Starting with ECS:
-----------------
ltuproxy has to be started first.
Modify script v/scripts/ltuproxy.sh (LD_LIBRARY_PATH) and start ltuproxy:

ltuproxy detector_name start
ltuproxy started without parameters gives short help.

See v/detector_name/WORK/*.log files.
LTU control software should be started now by command:
vmecrate detector_name
- this starts DIM client which connects to running ltuproxy.

Note about shared memory:
ltuproxy allocates, with first start, shared memory. LTU parameters placed
in this memory, are persistent -i.e. they stay the same even if ltuproxy
is restarted. These parameters:
- are loaded to shared memory from file v/detector_name/CFG/ltu/ltuttc.cfg
- can be modified (in shared memory) in 'Defaults editor' accessed
  by pressing button: Configuration -> Deafults editor

LTU FPGA firmware upgrade
-------------------------
Last version of the firmware is b5 (shown after the ltu software start).
This version (or higher) is used in all LTUs installed in experiment area.
Firmware files are placed in v/vme/CFG/ltu/*.rbf.

There is a link to current firmware file in $VMEWORK directory, i.e.:
FlashMem.cfg -> CFG/ltu/ltu_b5.rbf
The upgrade to the newest version is done by typing:

v/vme/scripts/loadLTUfpga ltu_b5.rbf 0x81x000

This script will create FlashMem.cfg link and loads the firmware
to LTU flash memory.

Wiring of the TTC partition (versions b0 and higher):
------------------------------------------------------

 LTU                            TTCex     wire
board                           board
