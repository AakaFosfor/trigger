cp *ync* $VMECFDIR/CFG/ltu/SLMproxy/
cp *ync*.slm $VMECFDIR/CFG/ltu/SLM/
i.e. *ync* files kept preferrably in  $VMECFDIR/CFG/ltu/SLMproxy/
(not in ltu_proxy/noclasses/)

VMELIBS env. variable introduced (default: /lib/modules/daq)
26.4.
v/SPECS/ directory introduced for .spec files (currently for ltuclient+ltusw)
26.4.
bin/vmebse_lab.bash  -use ideas for vmebse.bash (todo)
17.5.2013
getDAQClusterInfo()
daqlogbook_update_clusters()
called in ctp_proxy. Idea: move these calls later to pydimserver -i.e.
DAQlogbook (and hence mysql) needed ONLY on server.
Steps:
- find alternative way to DIM (seems UDT is ok also for 1GB smaqs)
- measure current InitPartition phases
- improve pydimserver.py (now .partition loaded 2x for
  pcfg and rcfg)
- move the DAQlogbook operations to server
- after the move of DAQlogbook operations to server, measure again
22.5.
prtProfTime() added in ctp_proxy
28.5.
ctp_proxy linked without mysql! (i.e. all daqlogbook updates
were moved to pydim). pysidm/server.c uses cshm* like ctpproxy
(i.e. not complete usage, only validLTUs and validCTPinputs)
