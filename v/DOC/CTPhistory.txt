27.1.2012
ctp_proxy.c: ctp_PausePartition:  stopTimer(255 instead of 0 
- now, the class counters in DAQlogbook during PAUSE should be treated
 the same way as they are when disabled due to time sharing
31.1.2012
in the pit:
1.
copy sync.seq/slm files to all CFG/ltu/SLM/directories:
doRightSeqs.bash  
 rcmd 7 'makeSLMproxylinks.bash v0' for all dets on all (2-7) machines  -
create link sync.seq -> /usr/local/trigger/v/vme/ltu_proxy/noclasses/sync.seq
in lab:
-scripts(unchange) copied from pit, 
-SLMproxy/sync.seq links for daq,ssd created
-SLM/sync.seq/slm files for daq,ssd created

7.2.2012
parted.py: BCMASKS: section in .rcfg contains ONLY used BCmasks (before:
also mask definitions of classes masked out when detectors masked out)
8.2.2012
l0ifun3/4 counters now ok (in vmeb/counters.py and cnames.sorted2)
17.2.2012
6 bits [30..25] are initialised to 0..49 in RATE_DATA -prepared for firmware
AF.
Modified: ctplib/dumpCTP,initCTP,Tpartition
Still todo: 
TRG_DBED/   
ctp_proxy/
ctp -classes widget

=============================20.2.2012        lab->pit
AE version of l0 board in the pit + sw updated in the pit
I.e. sw in lab+pit is now in sync, monscal++ still to be checked.
Notes from update: see trigger@alidcscom188:aj/f20/readme
4 new counters fo[1-4]l2rout[1-4] on each FO board:
fo1l2rout1 871 fo1 C HMPID
fo1l2rout2 872 fo1 C PHOS
fo1l2rout3 873 fo1 C CPV
fo1l2rout4 874 fo1 C N

21.2.2012
monscal++ in sync also

22.2.2012
bug fixed in parted.py: when .rcfg created, it could happen not all BC masks
wer shown in BCMASKS: section
22.2.2012
switched.py -adjusted for l0A/B (in addition to l0f in VALDI.CTPINPUTS)
23.2.
bug fixed (seems): problem: l0f34 LUTs have reversed order of bits -
i.e. vmeb/txtproc.py changed:
<5 bits table: returns normal bit string (as till now)
>4 bits table: returns reversed bit string
24.2.
vmeb/trigdb.py: bug fixed in getINT12(): return None is INT1/2 not defined
Now: in case INT1/2 not defined in ctp.cfg, .rcfg contains just 
INTERACTION: section line without NONE line
26.2. 
bcmasks processing for AB version bug fixed
CNTWEB/chlocpart.py ok (still needs better html)
27.2.
monitor/monitor.py html added
27.2.

from fmd,daq,ssd,hmpid (or trigger) account
see p2/cavern: 707

1.3.2012 l+p
parted.py fixed: l0f34 consisting only from 1 part (12 inputs used only)
now load correctly (i.e. empty LUT is encoded with 0x00000... in .pcfg file)
14.3.2012
svn commit: rev. 208
15.3.

521: IRS installation ongoing (by Ivan)
27.3.
switched.py modified: 
How to create new CTP.SWITCH/VALID.CTPINPUTS without affecting 
current run/configuration in the pit?
Use script switched4act.bash. This script operations:
- L0.inputs, CTP.SWITCH, VALID.CTPINPUTS are copied into temporary directory
- switched gui is started with these copies
- now change switch config (in gui) and
- Save only files (CTP SWITCH not loaded) and Quit
- updated CTP.SWITCH and VALID.CTPINPUTS are left in temporary directory
  (they can be uploaded into ACT)
28.3.2012
