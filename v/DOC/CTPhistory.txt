8.4.2013
batch of new LTUs tested by Graham.
8.4.2013
devel/archived introduced for archived packages (not used generally).
archived/ltutests.tgz -testing new LTUs (with special firmware).
Prepared from na62 LTU testing sw.
See: Bigtest/doBackup.bash   -how backup was done on altrip2 + install notes

also to be kept in mind (not in devel/archived):
devel/../rf2ttc.tgz
      ../atlas/BOBR

cp *ync* $VMECFDIR/CFG/ltu/SLMproxy/
cp *ync*.slm $VMECFDIR/CFG/ltu/SLM/
i.e. *ync* files kept preferrably in  $VMECFDIR/CFG/ltu/SLMproxy/
(not in ltu_proxy/noclasses/)
17.4.
VMELIBS env. variable introduced (default: /lib/modules/daq)
26.4.
v/SPECS/ directory introduced for .spec files (currently for ltuclient+ltusw)
26.4.
bin/vmebse_lab.bash  -use ideas for vmebse.bash (todo)
17.5.2013
getDAQClusterInfo()
daqlogbook_update_clusters()
called in ctp_proxy. Idea: move these calls later to pydimserver -i.e.
DAQlogbook (and hence mysql) needed ONLY on server.
Steps:
- find alternative way to DIM (seems UDT is ok also for 1GB smaqs)
- measure current InitPartition phases
- improve pydimserver.py (now .partition loaded 2x for
  pcfg and rcfg)
- move the DAQlogbook operations to server
- after the move of DAQlogbook operations to server, measure again
20.5.
some testing with UDP-based Data Transfer (UDT) Library - version 4
done (available from git server). 
Goal: to be used with SSM esp. after LS1 with new L0 10G ethernet readout.
See:
aj@pcalicebhm11:git/udt-git
trigger@altri1:udt4
22.5.
prtProfTime() added in ctp_proxy
28.5.
ctp_proxy linked without mysql! (i.e. all daqlogbook updates
were moved to pydim). pysidm/server.c uses cshm* like ctpproxy
(i.e. not complete usage, only validLTUs and validCTPinputs)
28.5.
linux/ctpshm.exe  -compiled/linked on client+server -i.e. only the last one
(i.e. according to where compile/link done) works
DAQlogbook opened/closed in pydim/server.c always when ctpproxy restarted
according to DIM message received from ctpproxy
31.5.2013
CNTRRD/analyse.c, option  gnu/dec/hexa added
6.6.
pac demo (for PAC with clusters) is in aj@11:h/wsgi.
