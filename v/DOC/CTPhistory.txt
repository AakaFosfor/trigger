8.4.2013
bin/vmebse.bash -echoint() added (no stdout when non-interactive shell)
8.4.2013
batch of new LTUs tested by Graham.
8.4.2013
devel/archived introduced for archived packages (not used generally).
archived/ltutests.tgz -testing new LTUs (with special firmware).
Prepared from na62 LTU testing sw.
See: Bigtest/doBackup.bash   -how backup was done on altrip2 + install notes

also to be kept in mind (not in devel/archived):
devel/../rf2ttc.tgz
      ../atlas/BOBR

17.4.2013
[pcalicebhm10] /home/dl/root/usr/local/trigger/devel/v/vme/ltu_proxy/noclasses >
cp *ync* $VMECFDIR/CFG/ltu/SLMproxy/
cp *ync*.slm $VMECFDIR/CFG/ltu/SLM/
i.e. *ync* files kept preferrably in  $VMECFDIR/CFG/ltu/SLMproxy/
(not in ltu_proxy/noclasses/)
17.4.
VMELIBS env. variable introduced (default: /lib/modules/daq)
26.4.
v/SPECS/ directory introduced for .spec files (currently for ltuclient+ltusw)
26.4.
bin/vmebse_lab.bash  -use ideas for vmebse.bash (todo)
17.5.2013
getDAQClusterInfo()
daqlogbook_update_clusters()
called in ctp_proxy. Idea: move these calls later to pydimserver -i.e.
DAQlogbook (and hence mysql) needed ONLY on server.
Steps:
- find alternative way to DIM (seems UDT is ok also for 1GB smaqs)
- measure current InitPartition phases
- improve pydimserver.py (now .partition loaded 2x for
  pcfg and rcfg)
- move the DAQlogbook operations to server
- after the move of DAQlogbook operations to server, measure again
20.5.
some testing with UDP-based Data Transfer (UDT) Library - version 4
done (available from git server). 
Goal: to be used with SSM esp. after LS1 with new L0 10G ethernet readout.
See:
aj@pcalicebhm11:git/udt-git
trigger@altri1:udt4
22.5.
prtProfTime() added in ctp_proxy
28.5.
ctp_proxy linked without mysql! (i.e. all daqlogbook updates
were moved to pydim). pysidm/server.c uses cshm* like ctpproxy
(i.e. not complete usage, only validLTUs and validCTPinputs)
28.5.
linux/ctpshm.exe  -compiled/linked on client+server -i.e. only the last one
(i.e. according to where compile/link done) works
DAQlogbook opened/closed in pydim/server.c always when ctpproxy restarted
according to DIM message received from ctpproxy
31.5.2013
CNTRRD/analyse.c, option  gnu/dec/hexa added
6.6.
pac demo (for PAC with clusters) is in aj@11:h/wsgi.
17.6.
git commit -a
24.6.
monitor/monitor.py -the server disk temperature monitoring added
28.6.
backup of /data/dl/root + snapshot to /mnt/alidcsfs001/Scratch/tri/2013
Idea: make it alice on diffrent computer (virtual?)
16.7.
monitor/monitor.py -hddtemp now hysteresis
CNTRRD/analyse.c   -bug fixed, header in output ascii file added
CNTRRD/analyse.py  -processing of data file obtained with analyse.c
pydim/bcmcheck.c   - added
17.7.
improved fanio/dim/server.c. Compiles+runs also in lab without hw (using
VMESITE env. vaiable).
22/23.7. PauseResume for clusters ongoing...
31.7. startswtrig() -> returns L2_ORBIT of event generation
5.8. new version of daqlogbook -used for slc6, Vasco compiled it for slc5
64bit. For 32bit: we do not need it (but in pit we have 32bit server) 
-all daqlogbook access should be done from
server
7.8.
ctp_Pause/ctp_Resume: more checks done, 
still todo: bakery locks (look for bakery) for Pause/Resume/Sync/clgroups
git pull
git commit --author Jusko
git push
3.10.
trigger/devel/archived moved up 1 level and emoved from git, i.e. is now in
trigger/
git commit -a  and push , new clone created on avmes /home/dl6/local/trigger

29.10.2013
plan:
/home/dl6/local/trigger -development version (git r/w) for altri1/2 avmes
/home/dl6/local/trigger_run1 -to be used for other diskless on CERN network.
                       - can be used also for the pit (if needed)
avmes: slc6 with altri1/2 -seems works from today -let's use it
                       for some days before:
update pcalicebhm10 to slc6 and move diskless server from avmes on it
30.10.2013
run1 user and branch created. whole trigger project cloned, i.e. now
in /home/dl6/trigger -> development
   /home/dl6/trigger_run1 -> with old (50 classes) boards + CERN public
     this one always branch run1 !
31.10.
'ctp' should work with new L0/L1/L2 (100 classes, see devdbg run1_todone).
run1 user seems ok. 6 commands compiling everything (3 on run1@avmes + 3 on
run1@altri1).
script -c 'makeall allctp' ~/allctp.make
script -c 'makeall allltu' ~/allltu.make
script -c 'makeall others' ~/others.make
Problem with 'Classes' widget in ctp is seen also with old sw (i.e. cannot
be open again when closed)
3.11.2013
vmeaistd.h MAXNAMES 400 -> 600
11.11.2013
bakery: the swtrigger lock now separated for ctp (2) and dims (3).
GenSwtrg_op() -special for ctp interface
Note: slightly different for run1 version (also modified)
11.11.2013
vmeb/trigdb.py cables   -added, printing the names of all L0+L1+L2 inputs
in L0.INPUTS + VALID.CTPINPUTS.
18.11.
trigger@aldaqctp2 -daq readout ok (see
trigger@altri1:$VMEWORKDIR/WORK/pat1.txt)
20.11.2013
ssmbrowser: allows save/restore including SSMs content
yet todo: stdalone browser for browsing on any comp (not vme)
28.11.
python -m compileall .   -recompile 
3.11.
ltu_proxy: daqlogbook usage moved to pydim/server.c (see history.txt)
ctplib/ttcmisubs.c moved to ttcmi/ttcmisubs.c (vme/ttcmidaemons linking
also modified accordingly)
3.12.
makeall ok on bhm10+altrip2, i.e.:
script -c 'makeall allctp clean' ~/makeall_allctp.log
script -c 'makeall allltu clean' ~/makeall_allltu.log
script -c 'makeall others clean' ~/makeall_others.log
13.1.2014
git push. We do not know about errors in LTU firmware (seems 100 classes
ok)
14.1.
FOs --> BUSY button in FOs action changed:
before: when pressed 'HW not updated indication' was not done
now: when the button pressed, 'HW not updated' indicator
     goes red and BUSY_CLUSTER word is than reprogrammed when HW written.
     This happens even if BUSY_CLUSTER words were not changed (but
     we are sure the displayed info agrees with HW).
23.1.2014 trigger@avmes:~/rpmbuild/RPMS/ltuclient-2.10-1.x86_64.rpm preapred
30.1.2014
BUSY_CTPDEADTIME was 60 before 30.1.2014
From now is 60+50=110 which corresponds to real deadtime (minimal
distance of 2 L0 in 2 non overlaping clusters) to 112BCs= 2.8us
todo: measure with scope
7.2.
rl@avmes,altri1: git way added. I.e.:
main development: trigger@avmes,altri1
Roman: rl@avmes,altri1
production for CERN public net: trigger@pcalicebhm10,altri2
12.2.
CNTWEB/ltus.py -grouping added
13.3.
CNTWEB/ltus.py -Yaxis logarithmic/linear added
19.2.2014
vme/fanio/dim  exportsc.bash added
12.3.
modifications for l1,l2 counters (300 counters each, 2-bit accumulators for slow counters)
15.3.
mod. for busy/fo. cnames.sorted2: 1560 lines, fo: 0xB0 problem with timing
18.3.
bug fixed in ltulib/ltuinit.c (did not recognize correctly ltuver2 boards
with numbers > 64)
18.3.
small bug fixed in ssmbrowser.py: now a ssm dump written only once
when asked to be saved together with signal names
21.3.
New rrd db created on avmes (1560 ctp counters). 
Conversion rrddb->dsiplayname (spare17->l0LMbv) done in CNTRRD/cnt.py.
Counter.co2rrdname() -changed. Now doing nothing, i.e. cnames.sorted2 names
are equal to those used in rrddb.
Prgrams using cnames.sorted2 should:
- recognize TSGROUP counter by looking for 'spare*TSGROUP'
- recognize 6 runx counters by looking for 'spare*runx'
1.4.2013
vme/fanio/dim/server.c -modified. 
-now it works together with PVSS SSD client.
-STATUS service automatically updated (no polling required from dim client)
3.4.2013
pydim/act_main.c ok now (using shm on server)
3.4.2013
ctpproxy start problem:

7.4.2014
local/trigger_run1 -cloned from github on bhm10. I.e. from now:
run1@altri1   -running run1 sw with new firmware
run1@altri2   -running run1 sw with old firmware -problematic, 
  only makeall allctp done, todo: better environment set...
10.4.2014
miclock_fifo.py -takes inputs from /tmp/micfifo instead of stdin. I.e. 
  prepared now to be driven from httpd and html intrface.

L0_INVERTac -the same for L0/LM0
L0_CONDIION -the same for L0/LM0
24.6.
ctp.printsetDSCG() -works for L0 + LM0
