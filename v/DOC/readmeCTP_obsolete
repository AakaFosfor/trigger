2.1. Testing new version of CTPDIM server:

A. How to prepare list of CTP counter names: see counters file in this directory

1. CTP sw 
-------------------
There is trigger account on each machine (altri1/2) with
production software (i.e. should be stable, but not the newest one).
On each machine, other user can use software installed in ~trigger
by using script aj@altri1:v/scripts/usevmebsw -this makes links
to ~trigger account on the same machine.

trigger account is used for:
- master copy of all .rbf files (see ~/bin/newfpga about adding new FPGA file)
  on altri1 machine (loadCTPfpga on altri2 loads the latest .rbf file
  from altri1)
- starting daemons: 
  - dim server see ~/bin/dimserver
    (ctp_proxy is started from ~ref account)
- ctp, ltu control/testing scripts:
  sedev      - set environment
  ctp        - start ctp software
  ltu ltu=base   - base is 0x81X000 where X is LTU dial

Sw update:
---------
1. master:  recompile all on aj@altri1 or rl@altri1
sedev
cd v/vmeb/vmeblib ; make
cd v/vme/ltu/ltulib ; make
cd v/vme/ctp/ctplib ; make
vmecomp ltu
vmecomp ttcvi
vmecomp ctp
cd ~/v/vme/MORELTUS ; make
cd ~/v/vme/ltudim
make linux/ltuserver
make linux/ltuclient   # on other machines too

cd ~/v/vme/ctp_proxy
make linux/ctp_proxy
make linux/test
make linux/dims   # started by ~trigger/dimserver
make linux/dimc   # client (can be started elsewhere)

2. update 
aj: 
scripts/distrib       --> vmebltu.tar    LTUsw distribution
trigger:
~/bin/ajupdate ALL   # update ~trigger/v       
        This makes update for all users using links to ~trigger/v
updaltri2            # push to ~trigger@altri2
3.
trigger@altri2:
change v/vme/ctp.c   NO DAQ present (see main)

1a. CTP operation - trigger account
-----------------------------------
In ~trigger/bin directory:
ajupdate ALL -updates all the software from aj account on the SAME machine
              (should be used only on altri1)
22.1.2007 to be done when altri2 switched on

updaltri2    - upgrades ~trigger@altri2 software. 
               Should be started on trigger@altri1.
               Note: after running this script, ctp.c at altri2 
               should be cahnged/compiled (no daq option in initmain()) 
newfpga      - copy new CTP FPGA from ~pedja directory to 
               ~trigger/v/vme/CFG/... leaving note in readme...
loadCTPfpga  - load CTP fpga
loadLTUfpga  - load LTU fpga
setdsenv     - set DIM/SMI env (alias sedev calls this script)
~aj/v/scripts/usevmebsw     - sets the user environment for
               any user to work with software installed in ~trigger account

From trigger account, following daemons are started:
ctp_proxy/linux/dims    -counters reading (service CTPDIM/MONCOUNTERS)
     See: 
     -script ~trigger/bin/dimserver to start it
     -v/vme/ctp_proxy/dims.c, dimccounters.c, readme,
          aj@pcalicebhm05:dimcdistrib/ -for client example

1b. CTP operation -ref account
-------------------------------
ref account:
cd ctp_proxy
getnew.sh           -take new version of ctp_proxy (backup made too) 
                     from ~aj
start_ctp_proxy.sh   -start ctp_proxy

2. CTPDIM server
----------------
Status 28.1.2007:
started from trigger account by script bin/dimserver.
Sources are in ~aj/v/vme/ctp_proxy/dims.c and dimservices.c
It reacts to following commands:
1.
CTPDIM/SWTRG Tswtrg_structure
The string is returned through CTPDIM/RESULT service:
SWTRG X:x         
  X -detector name
  x -number of successfull triggers
ERROR: error message
2.
CTPDIM/STATUS anystring
The string is returned through CTPDIM/RESULT service:
STATUS: 
name FB
...
3.
CTPDIM/MONCOUNTERS service, which returns 4*NCOUNTERS 32bit words
every minute

Testing new version of CTPDIM server:
-------------------------------------
cd ~aj/v/vme/ctp_proxy
modify Tpartition.h:   DEVELOP
make linux/dims
linux/dims
In aj@pcalicebhm05:dimcdistrib:
make linux/dimccounters
linux/dimccounters
