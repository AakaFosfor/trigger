In ACT, when modified through web interace, lines end with '0d0a'
while unix files end with '0a'.
dos2unix -n v.c v.c2
converts bad file (dos end of lines) to unix format.
If VALID.DESCRIPTORS is in dos format, some descriptors
are simply ignored -bad .rcfg fiel is created then.
Todo:
1. do not create file if some descriptor is missing!
2. modify parted to process dos format too
