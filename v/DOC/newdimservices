Vsetky sluzby by mali byt pouzite iba v pripade, ze nebezi globalny/stdalone
run (busytools a SMAQ moze bezat aj paralelne).
Master (dim client co bude volat tie sluzby), bude startovany rucne
najma po zmene TTCmi clocku.

LTU dimservices
---------------
1. DETNAME/GETBCPHASE ltufo
   ltufo: 1 for LTU BC phase measurement
          0 for FO  BC phase measurement
   Note:
     Toggling is expected in L1_data
   Operation:
   - read BC_DELAY_ADD, and set it to 0
   - set ADC_SELECT 
   - adcval= readADC()
   - set BC_DEALY_ADD back to original value
   RC: adcval

2. DETNAME/PLLRESET
   RC: confirmation 'PLLreset done' or 'not done' (LTU in global...)
    
3. DETNAME/ADCSCAN
   Note:
     Toggling is expected in L1_data
   Operation:
   - read BC_DELAY_ADD
     for bcdel 0..31:
       BC_DELAY_ADD= bcdel
       adcval= readADC()
   RC: array of 32 adc values

CTP dimservices
---------------
1. CTPDIM/TOGGLE detname onoff
   detname: the name of detector (according to VALID.LTUS)
   onoff:   1 start toggling
            0 stop  toggling

2. CTPDIM/CHECKPHASES
   Operation:
     - read BUSY_DELAY_ADD, set it to 0
     - measure BC phase for L0/1/2 BUSY INT boards
     - restore BC_DELAY_ADD
   RC:
     5 values for L0/1/2 BUSY INT boards

3. CTPDIM/SMAQ
DIM client subscribing to this service, specifies following
input:
- the condition triggering the SSM stop
  Note: now the condition is: 
    the change of the counter counting one of L0 CTP inputs

After subscribing to SMAQ service, the client receives
messages containing snapshot memory taken in the time when
condition was fulfilled.
Should the message:
- be compressed? 4Mwords are read word by word from
  VME, so I can imagine some simple compressing algorithm
  squeezing together 'equal neighhbouring words' 
- contain more information (time stamp, the value of the triggering
  counter)...?

5. DCS 
------
For the shutdown I will provide DIM service:
shutdown cratename
and
shutdown_status cratename
-we should agree on cratenames.

- Ivan Kralik IR monitoring -provides services:
  -total luminosity
  -luminosity per bunch

- BOBR should be read once per minute and BST messages should be
  published as DIM service
