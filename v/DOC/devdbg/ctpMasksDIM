Hi,
I am going to prepare DIM service publishing CTP BC masks (now available in
VALID.BCMASKS CTP config file).
Currently these masks define ALICE BC numbers we trigger on in ALICE:
B -colliding bunches
A -A bunches C -C bunches
E -empty bunches
D -bunches where cosmic events are allowed

I suggest for each of these separate DIM service.
Each service will publish BC numbers (0..3563) as text string,e.g:
301 303 305 307 309 311 313 315 317 319 321 323 325 327 329 331 333 335 337

The same string is present in CTP VALID.BCMASKS file
(as comment, i.e. starting with #B/A/C/E/D).

CTPRCFG/CS service is published on aldaqecs server.
Which server would you prefere to run wth this new server -aldaqecs or
alidcsdimdns ?

Todo:
server: input: VALID.BCMASKS + kick on (like CTPRCFG/CS)
services:
.../B
.../A
.../C
or .../AC ?
.../E
.../I
.../S

server in C:
- 'L2(HL)' -> list of numbers in C (available only in txtpoc.py)

or server in .py (use txtproc.py directly)
