Following parameters commented in T0 defaults file (in jan 2010):
ppdelay 3125    #
Gppdelay        3387    #
SBGO0DELAY      3446    # this was used by TTCvi
GBGO0DELAY      151     # 53  this was used by TTCvi

they should be removed completely later. 
Problem:
Are they ALL really useless (i.e. not used any more) with LTUvi version?
