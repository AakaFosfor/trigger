1. 22.3.2012 4 new FO counters (fi: fo_ae.rbf): TO BE TESTED!
  44..47:   L2a+L2r strobes    -last counters in 0xad version
  48..51:   L2a flag (message) -4 new counters in 0xae version
    see CFG/fo/readme +mail from Marian 22.3.2012)
    -pouziva sa, avsak countre nie su dostupne
  idea: do not change the length/positions in current big array (970 counters)
        but use spare counters -at least till LS1. Seems
        there are enough spares in BUSY (6x4=24, -> use BUSY spares
        spare871-894
  Todo: change only:
      V--- in this column: . -> done 4/5.7.2012
      ? ctp/ctp.h: NCOUNTERS_BUSY_SP1: to be used in ctpboards.numcnts 
          for BUSY + corection in readCounters of course -we can
          spare time reading 55 counters which do not exist anyhow on 
          BUSY board. NOT DONE YET
      . ctp/ctpcounters.h: NCOUNTERS_FOae 52
      . ctplib/readCounters.c
      . vmeb/counters.py (creating cnames.sorted2)
      . new dimcdistrib/cnames.sorted2
      . CNTRRD/cnt.py: foXl2routY corresponds to spare871-894 in RRD
         fix it directly in cnt.py (i.e. do not change cnames.sorted2, although
         this would be more general...)
  Plan:
  1. 1 board reading -check if counters works well
     top connector   
     36 l0
     40 l1
     44 l2
     48 l2r
     4.7.2012: l2r is counted (not L2a)
  2. implement the above Todo:
  done: 5.7.2012 -seems works now (cnames.sorted2 + counter in ctp exp. sw)

3. 2011: from Franco (see below)
--------------------------------
1) obviously now we do not change things ....
2) if the LTU goes to ERROR, the ECS must send a command to set it back to
STANDALONE_STOPPED:

We can implement this after the Ions run
Hi,
perhaps, if detector is not ready in time when its LTU is switched
to GLOBAL, ltuproxy should go to ERROR state. Now it
sets LTU to GLOBAL regardless of the busy state, so the busy
problem with this detector is discovered later -when SOD is
sent from ctpproxy.
Bye, Anton

5. BCmasks:
-----------
- check run 165413 -why only one E is seen in CS?
  50ns_1380b_1331_0_1320_144bpi12injAC.alice
- check where E can be put (2 LHC gaps? or max. hole before B bunches?)

lhc2alice.py should create following lines in VALID.BCMASKS:
B
A
C
E
D -cosmic
I -isolated
AC
ACE
S
SA
SC
Note:
.ACAC. -> translates to:
.acac.   where: c=SC and a=SA  resulting S-mask = SC + SA masks, i.e. also:
.SSSS.

Questions:
1. in main-sat. mode of running, what is -A- mask?
   - only first A in he comb ACAC
   - or any A (as in main-main mode of running)
Answer:
.A. -> A (similarly C)
.ACAC. -> .B
2.5.2012:

8. DIM services for Giacinto
----------------------------
see: SOLVED/FixedCounters4dcs -notes about dynamic way

8A. DIM services publishing VALID.BCMASKS
-----------------------------------------
seems direct string from VALDI.BCMASKS can be published with its name.
- better logs fron getdip.py

         masksServer...

9: migration 027->707+521
-------------------------
707:
smaq: infoLogger to be installed (64bit)
      -needs mysql (like Addons_32/MySQL but 64bits)

521:
2012 samba mounted directory is sufficient (i.e. unmount 2011)

10. ttcmidaemons
----------------
Ombretta: alarm is set for 250ps clock shift
If this happens during run, operator will be required to stop the run,
adjust the shift and start run again.
- preapre interface for operator 'set clock shift'
  see: ttcmidaemons/apply_any_shift
- there is 10ps in daqlogbook from last year always even if shift <250ps
  why?
- set minimal allowed shift (probably 20ps?, although 0 required)
Moreless done:
- shift now when >10ps, 'reset' command (undocumented) in miclock script
  makes adjustment according to the current shift (measurement have to be fresh!)

11. dims stopping
-----------------
Stop dims by mal byt
stale sprevadzany stopom vsetkych aktivnych runov (cize  
ked to nedostal od ctpproxy, tak ked ho stopneme, mal by
to urobit sam).

Also see devdbg counters_notread
- dimservices.c updated Nupdated counter holding the number of requests 
  from each client
Solved: <10secs -because 1/min reading update distributed over 7 clients
results in average update <10secs

11B. dims looping
-----------------
23.5.2012 morning: seems because bakery got stucked! Right restart:
Start daemons in this order:
1. stop monitor 
2. stop/start proxy (to get bakery cleaned ?)
3. start: dims rrd html ctpproxy

30.5. again: load on alidcsvme001: 3
Cure: enough to KILL ctpproxy and start again
see: savanah/bugs + 188:aj/problems/ctpproxy_looping
done - SIGUSR1 (and any signal) is intercepted when killing smaq

15. busy problems when starting global partition
------------------------------------------------
A: when only PHOS started in PHYSICS_2, EMCAL goes busy in active
PHYSICS_1  -see run 177927 + aj/emcal mail folder from 30.4.2012

B: Roberto reported this dependance (2.5.2012):
- first start partition with all detectors
- bring ZDC to busy and stop partition -> EOD is not sent (ZDC busy)
- when next run is tarted, TPC and/or MUON_TRK cannot start properly, why?
  It is known, only TRD is performing special action in time of EOD

17. infoLogger changed
----------------------
mail from Sylvain from 26th March:
Hello Anton,

setStream() was removed, please now use instead:
- infoLogger_setParam(INFOLOG_PARAM_FIELD_DETECTOR,"MCH");
to set the detector (3 letter code, not full name)
- infoLogger_setParam(INFOLOG_PARAM_FIELD_PARTITION,"PHYSICS_1");
to set the partition

you can also use, instead of the corresponding environment variables:
- infoLogger_setParam(INFOLOG_PARAM_FIELD_SYSTEM,"TRG");
to set the system name
- infoLogger_setParam_int(INFOLOG_PARAM_FIELD_RUN_NUMBER,12345)
to set the run number

Another mail from 24.8.2012:
There is no way to specify a default level.
The level should be assigned for each message
by using the function infoLogger_msg_xt().

Messages for the shifter should have level: INFOLOGLEVEL_OPS
Messages which may help oncalls should have level: INFOLOGLEVEL_DAQ
Messages intended only for experts should have level: INFOLOGLEVEL_DEV
You are free to decide in which category they belong (and it's fine
with me if you want to all put them in OPS as a first quick fix).
Ideally, one should just try to be clear an not too verbose in the OPS level
so that shifters are not confused.
i.e:
  infoLogS_f(severity, msg);
//infoLogger_msg_xt(__FILE__,__LINE__,UNDEFINED_INT,UNDEFINED_STRING,severity,INFOLOGLEVEL_OPS,msg);
-done 31.8.2012, still error reporting needs to be revisited 
 -see mail from 31.8. + infolog_trg2(...

From: Sylvain Chapeland <sylvain.chapeland@cern.ch>
To: Anton.Jusko@cern.ch
Subject: Re: infoLogger problem

Hello Anton,

Indeed, if calling a wrapper function, errsource and errline should be left
UNDEFINED_STRING and UNDEFINED_INT.

It would be very useful to assign error codes, e.g. to get statistics on
number of errors or document
what to do about some errors (e.g. wiki). I have just added the code range
32000-32999 to use by trigger system,
so you are free to assign codes as you wish in this range. Actually, this is
not limited to errors only,
you can also assign codes to non-error messages, e.g. to spot/count some
specific situations without having to parse the messages).
The 'severity' field says if it is an error or not.
When you have done, could you please provide an array with a short
description of each error code, so that I can
add it to infoLogger_errCodes.h ?
with the format as:

  {1000,"an error occurred in a logbook API call",NULL},
  {1900,"Not enough memory",NULL},
  {1901,"Error processing a DIM callback or command",NULL},
  {1902,"Internal inconsistency",NULL},

(last parameter can be a link to a web page with doc about the error code -
those of DAQ is always null because there
is a direct hook in our wiki)

While you are reviewing log messages, I have also the following suggestion:
'facility' field is currently different for each LTU (LTU_HMPID, LTU_SPD,
...)
but it could be the same everywhere (LTU), because there is already the
'detector' field which is set correctly for each of them (HMP, SPD, ...).
The facility is usually the same when the source code does not change. (but
you may keep the existing LTU_SPD... facilities if you prefer,
this remark was just for consistency with the other packages)

Let me know if you have any question about the log api, or if you need other
functions/interface for your purpose.

cheers,
Sylvain

20. trigger aliasses in DAQlogbook, see Vasco's mail from 20.8.2012
-------------------------------------------------------------------
DAQlogbook_update_triggerClassName() -one more parameter:
   const char **alias);  =>  NEW
The last parameter "alias" should be an array of strings containing the
names of the trigger alias of the given trigger class.
The last element of the array must be NULL.
example:
char *triggerAlias2[3]={"kSPI7-B","kCalibBarrel",NULL};
an example of line in aliases.txt file:
CMLL8-S-NOPF-MUON kMLL8-B,kCalibMuon,kCalibOuter

Todo:
- aliases.txt act->local when ctp configured 
  Done in lab: 21.08
- parse file aliases.txt in: vmeblib/daqlogbook.c 
  daqlogbook_update_triggerClassName() -called from pydim/server.c
  I.e. search in aliases.txt should be implemented this way:
  pydim/server.c:
  -add aliasesupdate cmd in DOcmd() (like csupdate), updating
   aliases[] array from aliases.txt, and also when server.c started.
   Done: 24.8.2012
  -aliasesupdate is issued from bin/ctpproxy.py (i.e. CTP reconfigured)
   An example of DIM cmd sent is in colschedule.bash. 
   Done: 24.8.
  -this array is searched in daqlogbook_update_triggerClassName(),
   to prepare alias parameter for daqlogbook. NULL to be passed
   if alias[es] not found for given class
   Done: 24.8.
- modify vmeblib/daqlogbook.c (adding char **aliases parameter to 
  wrapping function) Done.
- test in lab with new daq logbook interface:
  10:vmeblib> make
     vme/pydim> make
     startClients.bash ctpproxy stop
     startClients.bash pydim stop/start
     startClients.bash ctpproxy start
  altri1: ctpproxy.sh starttest
  Done: 30.8.2012, prepared for update in the pit

21. INIT_PARTITION command to ctpproxy. 
--------------------------------------
- Goal: update info about triggering detectors in daqlogbook
- the same set of parameters as LOAD_PARTITION
- can be invoked more times (before LOAD_PARTITION is received)
- goes to ERROR if syntax error found (like LOAD_PARTITION)

Notes: 2nd update in daqlogbook may finish with error (i.e. to be ignored)
Modifications:
- modify main_ctp.c for "INIT_PARTI..." cmd  (Done:24.8)
- modify ctp_proxy.c:
  finding triggerring detectors list in ctp_proxy.c: should be abandoned?
  - updateDAQClusters() called only from: ctp_LoadPArtition
    (see mail to Franco from 27.8.2012)...
!!! They prefer WAY1 _> i.e. just do the same actions in time of INIT
    and do nothing in time of LOAD.
    ctp_proxy.c: modified according to this suggestion 28.8.2012
    30.8.2012: main_ctp.c + ctp_proxy.c:
    - execute INIT_PARTITION in one case (INIT or LOAD) only, never
      in both.

Following (WAY2) abandoned 29.8.2012:
  icfg: modified 'pcfg' DIM cmd to be issued- cannot be the same way as later 
  in LOAD_PARITION: we do not know yet allocation of classes.
  Format:
  "icfg pname runnumber act_config"
- modify pydim/server.c
  leave it propageted by stdout to .py phase, where validation is
  done like in validate.py. Results can be passed back to .c
  through stdin (like 'class ' command) where they can be used for DAQ update
- very likely, the update of triggering inputs should be then removed from
  LOAD_PARTITION phase.
  
24. 23.08.2012 vmeblib/infolog.c new level not set by default
-------------------------------------------------------------
31.8.2012:
