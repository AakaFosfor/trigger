Status 20.4.2011
The main goal of SMAQ is:
1) check alignment and noise  of CTP inputs
2) check if correct filling scheme is loaded
It also checks the efficiency of 0BPA/C signals.

SMAQ is running on alidcscom027, requesting SSM data from
alidcsvme001 through ssh -usually 40 SSMs = 40x 4MBytes. 
The data are processed by root macro on alidcscom027. 
Root GUI is used for interface with operator to do measurement 
at the begining of each fill. The results of measurement 
(at least 2 .jpg files) are archived manually in DAQ logbook.

Current version of DQM is checking the point 2) -it checks 
whether events come in allowed BCs according to current 
filling scheme.

Known issues with SMAQ (in order of importance):
- only L0 inputs are measured, we need also L1 inputs 
- restart needed with each new filling scheme
- tedious archive in DAQlogbook
- cfg file needed (at least for list of shown channels)
- dashed line should be autoamtically displayed with
  each shown B-bunch
- perhaps improved triggering on classes and/or combination
  of inputs

To profit from DQM bookkeepping and still allowing SMAQ to run
at any time (DQM is active only during DAQ data taking) I suggest
to run DIM service all the time. The service will publish on request
the batch of L0+L1+L2 SSMs.
Then we will have 2 DIM clients -current SMAQ (scp will be 
replaced by DIM communication) and DQM. In DQM we can
process raw SSMs provided by DIM, or just take histograms
created in SMAQ and archive them -i.e. in this case DQM
would be used just as archiving tool.

Our DQM today is in hands of Evgeny, while SMAQ is maintained by David.
Please give your comments, at least if you would be available for
these improvements this year. I do not hink I can do something
before June (even June is tight...).
Best regards, Anton
