Problem:
htmlCtpBusys.py daemon (started through startClients.bash) has to be
started in order to get correct WEB counters (i.e.
it is not enough if 'startClients.bash status readctpc' is running).

Reason:
readctpc.c sends (per min) to htmlCtpBusys actual busys for each
detector over 
prw-r--r--  1 trigger alice 0 Jan 14 03:05 /tmp/htmlfifo

Suggested fix:
Send Error message when starting rrd 'producer' (startClients)
daemon at least! 
Even better: in readctpc.c: always when /tmp/htmlfifo has
no 'consumer' at its other end at the start (it does not block,
if htmlCtpBusy daemon is stopped after the readctpc start).

Notes:
after stop/start rrd (readctpc and readltuc),
CTP counters do not work (neither htmlbusy). Actually, htmlbusy daemon
crashed after 'rrd stop/start':
