32. 07.12.2012 smaq mutual L0/L1 alignment
------------------------------------------
1. I will modify bin/smaq script for 2 synchronous SSMs this way:
   Now 1st parameter (ctp_input) is number 1..48.
   Numbers 101..148 would indicate a 'double SSM request', i.e.:
   - 2 SSMs taken, the L0-SSM started always before the L1-SSM
   - it is guaranteed, that the time difference between starts
     is < 88us, i.e. precise delay can be found from Orbit position
     in both SSMs
   - resulting file will be 2x longer (4194304 * 2bytes). First half
     of the file contains the L0-SSM, the L1-SSM is given in 
     2nd half of the file.

2. prepare application showing the relative shift of any L1 input 
   (or simply all?) wrt to choosen L0.
   Is there a chance to prepare it before p-A run?

todo:
vme/smaq.c: 
inputsSMAQ(int intboard ,int inpnum012)
and in 
getSSMs():

setomSSM(board123,0xb); startSSM1(board123);
->
problem with stop, similar to the starting one (orbit time)
