We do not keep the realtaion between LHC/CTP orbit numbering.
Solution:
Just another line needs be added to the timing config,
format of the line (coming just after L012 line) would be:

LHC clock ctporbit lhcturn utcsecs utcmics
where:
clock: beam1, beam2, ref or local
ctporbit: int (24 bits)
lhcturn: int (32bits). The LHC turn corresponding to ctporbit
          (i.e. received in BST message in time of ctporbit)
utcsecs/utcmics:  Universal time read from BST message together with
lhcturn (seconds/microseconds, each 32 bits).
These data would allow to find the relation
between the numbering of orbits in ALICE and LHC.

Antonello's suggestion: all the BST data should be put into timing
config.

Notes:
the service CTPDIM/MONBST,see ctp_proxy/dimservices.c  is foreseen 
for DCS (not yet tested)
