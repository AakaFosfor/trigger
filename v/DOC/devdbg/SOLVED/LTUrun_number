Now ltuproxy is not aware of run number. For log, it is required
to set DATE_RUN_NUMBER env. varibale, so the log message
from ltu proxy can be filtered with run number too.

Modifications: done 19.5.
ltu_proxy.c
infolog_SetStream(dimservernameCAP,-1) ->
Add: -process RUN_NUMBR parameter
infolog_SetStream(dimservernameCAP,RUN_NUMBER)
for actions: START, NV_GOTOGLOBAL
and
for actions: STOP,NV_GOTOSTANDALONE_STOPPED
RUN_NUMBER=-1; infolog_SetStream(dimservernameCAP,RUN_NUMBER)

May 12th:
The next version of the ECS will send to the LTU START commands with 'at
least 3' parameters

START(CONFIGURATION, MODE, RUN_NUMBER)

The number of parameters will not always be 3.

There will be one exception.

During V0 GATE_TUNING runs the existing version of the ECS sends START
commands with 3 parameters.

The next version will send START commands with 4 parameters

 START(CONFIGURATION, MODE, RUN_NUMBER, FINEDELAY1)

PS I have 'discovered' the (obviously forgotten) exception when trying
to modify the code. I hope I have not missed other exceptions.
