Problem:
to copy definition of interaction record from ctp.cfg file to rcfg file.
It should be in the format of logical function of input names.

Current status (TRG_DBED/DOC/rundemo3.rcfg):
# Interaction is any function of first 4 L0 inputs (look-up table)
# ored with signals RND1,RND2,BC1,BC2
# Resulting INT* is logical OR of signals. In this example:
# INT1 is defined as (VZERO & SPD_GF0) OR BC1
# INT2 is defined as VZERO
INTERACTIONS:
INT1  0FMB2 BC1 
#INT2  0xcccc -rejected -we use symbolic expression

0FMB2 is defined in L0FUNCTIONS -which is not quite correct.

Explanation:
L0 functions: there can be max. 2 definitions used for L0 inputs in one time
INT functions: in addition there are 2 INT functions.
The question is:
Should definition of INT functions be given in L0FUNCTIONS section?
I see 2 ways how to cope with this:
1. (I prefere this way):
There are no INT function names -INT1 INT2 are directly defined
in INT1/2 lines (with BC1/2 RND1/2 added with '|' operator
2. 
If yes, we should agree at least on different names for INT functions.
L0 functions starts with '0' (currently with 'l0f'), let's INT functions
start with 'intf'.

------------
22.1.2010 solved (see 1. above)  and tested in lab.
Old way (i.e. lookup table with added BC1/2 RND1/2 -as they
are loaded in ctp (propagates from ctp_proxy though DIM to pydim) is
left as comment lines in .rcfg too
