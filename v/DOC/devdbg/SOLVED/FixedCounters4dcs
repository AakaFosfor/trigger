Goal:
provide certain set of class counters as DIM service. The rel. position
of these counters in the array is fixed (value is 0 if class not defined).

How to achieve it:
A:
-ctpdims will provide additional service: 
CTPDIM/MONLUMCNTS.

B:
- there is global definition of 'what is sent to DCS at fixed positions'.
The definition is used ONLY by ctp_proxy, when creating message 
STARTRUNCOUNT for ctpdims .
This definition is:
int fixedadd; // 0,1,... (adress in output array provided by DIM)
int type;  //raw input, class_before_vetos,...
char name[40];   // input/class name (0TSC,CMUS1-AC-NOPF-ALLNOTRD)

C:
- ctpdims keeps information about loaded partitions. This info
is received from ctp_proxy inside STARTRUNCOUNT/STOPRUNCOUNT
commands.
--------------------Proposal (later):
Structure ActiveLumCounters is allocated 7 times (6 partitions+
1 global one) in ctpdims (no need in ctp_proxy !).
-------------------- NOW: ONLY PHYSICS_1 partition considered
(i.e. only 1 allocation for PHYSICS_1 is enough).

ActiveLumCounters:
run_number
0  rel. position in array970 (all ctp counters) array, -1:not active
1
2
...
MaxActiveLumCounters-1

D:
- ctpdims in time of STARTRUNCOUNT:
  update 
- ctpdims in time of STOPRUNCOUNT:
  -apply received info,i.e. remove given run from ActiveLumCounters
  -go through all active partitions and recreate new ActiveLumCounters[0]

E:
- ctp_proxy finds out at the LOAD_PARTITION time which classes
will be active (by analysing .rcfg file). Info is sent to
ctpdims through STARTRUNCOUNT DIM command later when run starts.
Convenient place where to keep it is Tpartition structure.

F:
- STOPRUNCOUNT cmd to ctpdims stays the same (i.e. only run number)


Modifications:
E: no need to keep it in Tpartition (send directly to dims only
with PHYSICS_1 partition).

Status 14.9.:
ctp_proxy/fixedcnts.c -it is enough to change table here
(up to max. 50 counters), relink ctpproxy and restart
