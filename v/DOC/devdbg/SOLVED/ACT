Problem:
only .partition file is loaded, when seen in ACT in time of LOAD_PARTITION
command.
Goal:
Together with .partition, active files should be loaded
and corresponding actions done:
1. check if global partition is running (must not)

2. L0.INPUTDB,VALID.CTPINPUTS, VALID.BCMASKS,
VALID.DESCRIPTORS, ctp.cfg 
ltuttc.cfg files for participating detectors

consider archive of rewritten files (now .partition file simply
rewrites the one in pardefs directory)

3. actions:
 -reload CTP switch (if necessary?)
 -restart ctpproxy
5.2.2010 after discussion with Franco:
- ctpproxy start should have 1 parameter more: actstart ->
  before start:
  - download files from ACT
  - reload the CTP switch
Files:
ctp.cfg 
L0.INPUTDB,VALID.CTPINPUTS, CTP.SWITCH
VALID.BCMASKS,
VALID.DESCRIPTORS, 
See:
switched.py actget
ctpproxy/main_act.c
4.2.2010
Request from ECS: provide library/exe validating the
.parition file with corresponding VALID.CTPINPUTS,DESCRIPTORS
actually: L0.INPUTDB+CTP.SWITCH should be considered too  or
CTP.SWITCH schould be created from L0.INPUTDB + VALID.CTPINPUTS
and loaded to CTP switch.
I.e.
validate.exe inputs: .partition,VALID.CTPINPUTS(L1/L2),
     DESCRIPTORS, L0.INPUTDB
out: CTP.SWITCH, VALID.CTPINPUTS (ok)
     none -not possible to program the CTP switch

Done:
- 2 phases (see twiki)
  1. CTP conf download from ACT (seldomly)
    and bin/ctpproxy.py (automatic start from ECS)
  2. .partition download from ACT with each partition start
- see vme/validate, TRG_DB/validate.py
