Problem: only 1 partition is allowed to use time sharing
among its classes. Timing for each class group is hardcoded in 
cfg2part.c clg_defaults variable.

Goals: 
------
1. configurable time for all the classgroups. -preferrably
   in ctp.cfg file
2. add 1 comment line in CLASSES section of .rcfg file:

CTRUE-ABCE-NOPF-CENT 1 EMPTY one {NONE} {BCM1} -2147483618 1
#ClassName HW Descriptor Cluster PF      BCM  Prescaler  All(1) group time
#CTRUE-ABCE-NOPF-CENT 1 EMPTY one {NONE} {BCM1} -2147483618 1 0 0

3. make it clear what does it mean, if only 1 time sharing group present

4. timed groups are allowed only for 1 partition.
There is no check if another partition is using it. If
time sharing used by 2 partitions, ctp_proxy crashes.

5. show TIMESHARING line in parted's help

Solutions:
----------
4.
30.11.2009 fixed in lab -i.e. another partition with 'timed groups' not allowed
Todo: allow it in more partitions -all partitions would share time slots
      assigned to 'time class groups'
1. 
fixed 20.1.2010. see line TIMESHARING 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
in ctp.cfg file
2., 5.
done 20.1.2010. (each class has now comment line with clgroup +time)
3.
If only 1 time sharing group present, it is activated with given time.
After deactivation, counters are read and the same class group is
activated again -i.e. it is running nearly all the time, with
exception of reading counters, when global busy prevents all triggers
in this partition.
