From counters readings it seems that first and last readings
have extra dead time. 
Possible reason can be non optimal reading of counters
at start and stop of the run.
Counters readings at the start of the run and at the stop of the run
should be done as close as possinle to daq busy.
To be checked if it can be improved.
24.2.2010
ctp_StartPartition(): 2secs between conters reading and physics
ctp_StopPartition(): 1secs between setALLDAQBusy and conters reading.EOD sent
                     after counters reading.
Solution:
2.2.2010
2secs/1secs at SOD/EOD moved (SOD: read+unsetBUSY, EOD:setBUSY+read)
