The goal: we start cal. triggers from ctp expert sw. The problem is
--------
their generation is not stopped before EOR automatically, (our
shifter cannot keep it under control in ACR).
Quick fix: arrange automatic stop of cal. triggers at the EOR using
---------
shared memory.


Modify:
1. 
ctplib/ctpshm.c -add cshmGlobalDets() returning
bit mask of all detectors in all global runs. 
2. 
check if all calibrating detectors are in global in
swtrigger.c GenSwtrg() -it is ivoked from ctp/testclass.py. Return 12345678 (magic number) triggers
generated, if at least 1 detector is NOT in global run.
3. 
ctp/testclass.py: modify gensw/gensw1 methods.
if status[0]=='12345678'
  stop cal. triggers
4. 
ctp_proxy: arrange the call of cshmDelPartition(part->name),
as soon as possible, after partition was stopped
