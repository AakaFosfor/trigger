Problem:
TRD wants to analyse CTP readout, but they do not have info
about our inputs (15.1.2010):
Currently, only 'USED' CTP inputs are written, but your
case calls for 'ALL' to be written in config file (now
we do not have information about the trigger inputs
in CTP readout!).
I found, in our achive, following info about trigger
inputs from the time of run 105143:
InName = Det Level  Signature InpNum
0OBE   = TOF    0        65     14
0OB3   = TOF    0        63     18

Todo:
include all ctp inputs in .cfg file
Done in March 2010
