Problem:
14.1.2010: Pietro Antonioli's request (see the end of this note):
Because of their (t0 + tof) limitations in TDC, they cannot work
with cal. trigger close to the Orbit (current CALIBRATION_BC 3556).
They want to have cal. trigger sooner 3526 at least,  3520 would be
save.
Suggested solution:
allow CALIBRATION_BC as parameter in ltuttc.cfg. This parameter
will be Used:
- for LTU -CALIBRATION_BC register)
- in CTP (ctplib/swtrigger.c) when global calibration initiated
  TC_SET[11..0] -the same as CALIBRATION_BC in LTU
- PP_TIME calculation for LTU (24.1.2010) is:3479-ppL0
  (it should be 3490-ppL0 according to timingpars.c and 'Timing of TTC
  partition - LTUvi version)
- it seems no other register(s) are affected

TOdo:
ltu_proxy: 
- take CALIBRATION_BC + PP_TIME from ltuttc.cfg file (current way)
- change the formula in ltuttc.cfg calculating PP_TIME:
  PP_TIME= CALIBRATION_BC - 77- ppL0;
global calibration:
- in ctp expert sw and in calib.daemon (swtrigger.c): take it from 
  corresponding ltuttc.cfg file (?-ACT? or we start our SQLdb?) 
  or from ltuproxy (DIM)

Done:
25.1.2010: ltu_proxy side done, i.e.:
ltuproxy: new service CALIBBC added (can be tested with ltudim/linux/ltucmd)
          to be called from ctplib/swtrigger.c)...
new parameter (CALIBRATION_BC, calibbc in Tltucfg structure) 
added in ltuttc.cfg.
26.1.2010
ctplib/swtrigger.c -contacts ltuproxy to get right CALIBRATION_BC
ctp/testclass.py   -modified (cal. trigs+CALIBRATION_BC requested
                    from corresponding ltuproxy by default)
PP_TIME= CALIBRATION_BC - 77- ppL0
is now in $dbctp/../../ltu/ltuttc.cfgall

OK, tested in lab

Subject: event bunch selected for calibration event

Dear Anton,

as I anticipated to you by phone we finally identified today an horridous
bug (which I would call "TDC vulnerability"), which affected
calibration data of T0 (taken with pre-pulse and calibration triggers).

In short the TDC in use at TOF and T0 detector showed
producing crazy results (in terms of hit matching and hit time)
if a bunch reset reaches the chips very close after an L1 is
delivered to chips.

In practice currently calibration triggers are sent (L1) at bunch
3557. We found that are safe for us only triggers before bunch
3520. It is a microsecond before but still well within LHC gap veto
window so I hope it will not be a problem for you to modify
that parameter.

I guess this param is common to all detectors, but perhaps
we could make it different (within a specific window) between
the various sub-systems if there are specific requests.
I'm cc-copying Pierre because I'm not sure of DAQ implications
of such an approach. In that case individual detectors
should have, in my opinion, a key in the ltu config file
to modify the CALIBRATION_BC register you showed me today.

Cheers, Pietro
