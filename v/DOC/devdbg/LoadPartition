Why we check resources 2 times in ctp_LoadPartition:
 HWold<-HW
 ...
 if((ret=checkResources(part))) 
 ...
 if((ret=addPartitions2HW(AllPartitions))){ //just check if enough resources
 -this creates HW, but HW is later restored from HWold

  Perhaps the reason is:
  int checkInputs(Tpartition *part){
  return(0);
  i.e. inputs are not checked at all (but they are checked in addPArtitions2HW() )
