Notes about syncdownscalinog: L0 fi >= 0xAF
#define L0_SDSCG        0x98c8    /* +4*n n=1,....,50, 0x98cc..0x9990*/ 
Default values for these registers: 0,1,2,3,...,49.
i.e. downscaling group for class1 is 0, ..., class50 is 49.
Goals:
-----
- 0..49 are replaced by symb. names in .partition definitions
- if SDG rpesent, the first (lowest class number) class keeps random downscaing factor,
  the remaining classes of the group points to this one.

New .partition syntax:
- adding one new parameter in class definition: sdg=id. 
Classes defined with the same sdg parameter will be downscaled synchronously,

todo:
parted

ctp:
---

Downscaling field now given with each class in Classes window.
It would be natural to add another column: sdg (L0_SDSCG registers content, 
i.e. 0..49 by default. If different, sync. downscaling is active). This
is not urgent, the SDSCG content can be examined/modified by
SimpleTests->printsetSDSCG

parted todo:
-----------
 -from/to .partition file
 -from/to display
 -to .pcfg
 -to .rcfg

.partition
a 0.1%         #line defining sync. downscaling group
a -any identifier (starting with letter) different from BC1/2 RND1/2 BCM*
...
DINT1(L0pr=a)   #present with each class synchronously downscaled
Errors:
L0pr present together with sdg in class definition (L0pr and sdg are mutually exclusive) -cannot happen (we use L0pr parameter, not special sdg=))
Double definition of a sdg name 
Synchronously downscaled classes not in the same TS group (Warning?)

.pcfg   (see ctp_proxy/readme):
SDG agrup 0x1fae13
SDG c 0x1fae13
...
CLA.01 0xbfffffff 0x0 0x7ffffff1 0x1fae13 0x1fffffff 0x0 0x1f000fff
CLA.01 0xbfffffff 0x0 0x7ffffff1 agrup 0x1fffffff 0x0 0x1f000fff

Assignment to the physical class will be done in ctp_proxy (when
real class numbers are known)

New .rcfg syntax:
----------------
+1 column for each class sdg (7th l0pr-column is valid in all cases):
0     -BUSY downscaling (implies no sync downscaling)
1..50 -sync. downcaling group (cn-1 into DSCG register...)
       default: class number
i.e. sdg column for class3:
  3 or missing     -> 'no sync downscaling'
  0                -> busy downscaling
  1<=n<=50 (n!=3)  -> sync. downscaling with class n 

History:
July 2012:
0xaf loaded in lab (pit is still with 0xae)
July 2012:
If >=0xaf, sdg register for each class is initialized to class-1 (ctplib/initCTP.c)
Supporting routine written in ctp/ctp.c
-> SimpleTest -> printsetSDSCG

6.9.2012
ctp_proxy/readme -definition of .pcfg file changed (SDG + CLA lines)
