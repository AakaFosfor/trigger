Notes about syncdownscaling: L0 fi >= 0xAF
New .partition syntax:
- adding one new parameter in class definition: sdg=id. 
Classes defined with the same sdg parameter will be downscaled synchronously,
ONLY ONE of them has to define required random downscaling (L0pr=10%).
I.e. parted:
-----------
a 0.1%         #line defining sync. downscaling group
a -any identifier (starting with letter) different from BC1/2 RND1/2 BCM*
...
DINT1(sdg=a)   #present with each class synchronously downscaled
Errors:
L0pr present together with sdg in class definition
Double definition of a sdg name 

.pcfg   (see ctp_proxy/readme):
SDG a 0x1fae13
SDG c 0x1fae13
...
CLA.01 0xbfffffff 0x0 0x7ffffff1 0x1fae13 0x1fffffff 0x0 0x1f000fff

Assignment to physical class will be done in ctp_proxy (when
real class numbers are known)

New .rcfg syntax:
----------------
+1 column for each class sdg:
0     -BUSY downscaling (implies no sync downscaling)
1..50 -sync. downcaling group (cn-1 into DSCG register...)
       default: class number
i.e. sdg column for class3:
  3 or missing     -> 'no downscaling'
  0                -> busy downscaling
  1<=n<=50 (n!=3)  -> sync. downscaling with class n 

History:
July 2012:
0xaf loaded in lab (pit is still with 0xae)
July 2012:
If >=0xaf, sdg register for each class is initialized to class-1 (ctplib/initCTP.c)
Supporting routine written in ctp/ctp.c
-> SimpleTest -> printsetSDSCG

6.9.2012
ctp_proxy/readme -definition of .pcfg file changed (SDG + CLA lines)
