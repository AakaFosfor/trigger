Notes about syncdownscaling: L0 fi >= 0xAF
New .rcfg syntax:
+1 column for each class sdg:
0     -BUSY downscaling (implies no sync downscaling)
1..50 -sync. downcaling group (cn-1 into DSCG register...)
       default: class number
i.e. sdg column for class3:
  3 or missing     -> 'no downscaling'
  0                -> busy downscaling
  1<=n<=50 (n!=3)  -> sync. downscaling with class n
