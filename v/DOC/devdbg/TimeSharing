Problem:
-------
The reading of counters:
- per minute
- SOD/EOD readings
- timesharing group change reading

is not synchronised (should be).
It is not clear, what is the relation between TSGROUP (895 word in
CTP counters) and timesharing conters reading. Request:
Ma platit:
'countre maju ten group , ktory bol
aktivny ked countovali'
R

2 problems:
A. TXGROUP counter not cleaned at the EOR
B.
TSGROUP counter == 'active group number' for reading which
is FINISHING the active item of this group.

Current status:
active cl. group is passed throug shared memory
see: Tctpshm.active_cg
- 0 if no group is active
>0  if TS group is active

ctp_proxy/clgroups.c/cgInterrrupt()
  clgroup= nextclassgroup(part);
  ...
  updateTotalTime(part);   // +force counters reading
    xcountersStart(0);    // force xcounters read 
  enableclassgroup(part, clgroup);  // also in shm
    
Modified:
B.
shm updated AFTER forced counters reading:
- command sent over dim with new clgroup
- counters are read
- dims modifies shm active_cg after reading
i.e. modified:
clgroups.c:
  enableclassgroup():
  -ctpshmbase->active_cg= setclgroup; removed
  cgInterrupt()
  -updateTotalTime() +1 parameter (class group)

ctp_proxy.c
  xcountersStart() +1 parameter

dimservices.c
  readcounters() +1 parameter
and more...
Note:
During paused state, shm.active_cg is 0.
A.
ctp_proxy, in stop_Partition:
ctpshmbase->active_cg=0;
in case no TS partition left after deleting stopped partition

Todo:
to be tested
