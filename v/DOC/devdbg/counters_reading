Problem:
in offline, there are 2 equeal readings of ctp counters sometimes.

Counters reading is initiated from 2 independent processes:
1. ctp_proxy: at the SOR/EOR:
SOR:
 generateXOD
readCounters(mem, CSTART_SPEC, 0);
xcountersStart(part->run_number);   ->DIM request to dims
EOR:
 xcountersStop(run_number);         ->DIM request to dims
 generateXOD
Pause:

2. dims: -from main and from thread
- cthread()  - 1/min
  readctpcounters(0);
- getcnts()  -on request (SOR/EOR Pause/Resume)
  readctpcounters(cid);
- startruncounter(), stopruncounter()
  readctpcounters(0);

dimservices.c:  2 threads:
cthread() {
  readctpcounters(0);
  sleep(60)
}
void bstthread(void *tag) {
  nextBSTdcs(vspbobr, bstmsg, 1);
  sleep(BSTINTSECS) -10 secs
}

Solution:
---------
- critical section can be locked/unlocked by usage of 
  shared memory + bakery (or semapphors)
23.11.2011
Tbakery ccread; introduced in ctp shared memory:
Tpartition.h, ctp_proxy.c -initBakery
readCounters

getCounter
getCountersBoard
clearCounters

still todo: check if all customers (5) are sahring ctp shared memory

Problem2:
during Pause, CSTART_TSGROUP counter is set to 0.
27.1.2012 agreed with Roman: should be set to 255, so DAQlogbook
counters for paused classes can be updated the same way as non-active
classes (time sharing).
Modifications:
ctp_proxy.c: ctp_PausePartition  stopTimer(255 instead of 0
