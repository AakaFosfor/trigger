Services provided by CTP:
------------------------
They are accessed through DIM servers running on CTP SBCs:
-1 CTP DIM server
-1 DIM server for each LTU

1. The services setting the parameters in hardware:
   A. stdalone mode: LTU/TTCvi are under the control 
      of the detector group. There is GUI similar to the one delivered
      with LTU board. 
   B. global mode:   all parameters (CTP,LTU,TTCvi) are set by ECS.

   Calibration services is special case (managing request queues)

2. Getting information about CTP operation (global or detector 
   dependent parameters, variables).
   Types of information supplied:
   - 'LIVE' data from CTP or shared memory: 
      BCMx, RNDx, BCx settings ...
      CTP/LTU counters
   - 'CONFIGURATION' data on disk (ECS database): 
      available trigger descriptors, PFs (used by config. editor)...

1. CTP services
---------------
Enabled during run (in stdalone mode implemented by ltu ctp emulator).

Command                  Parameters
Generate_cal_trigger     detector      detector name
                         roc
                         N             number of triggers
 -PP is always delivered
 -it can happen that trigger itself is not delivered

Generate_sw_synchronous  detector
                         roc
                         N
                         bc            BC number

Generate_sw_asynchronous detector
                         roc
                         N
                         bcmask        1 - 4

Get_status                             return number of generated triggers
                                       after last Generate command

Following services are implemented directly as SMI commands
(they are activated by ECS only):

Generate StartOfData     DAQpartition
Generate EndOfData       DAQpartition

Set DAQbusy              DAQpartition  set of(1 - 6) or all
Clear DAQbusy            DAQpartition

2. Getting information about CTP operation

Services provided by triggering detectors:
-----------------------------------------
   - start/stop toggle N               N -input number
   - start/stop signature N
   - status
