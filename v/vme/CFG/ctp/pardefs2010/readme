hidaqtest
partition for heavy ions test:
- 2 ts groups
- 2 clusters (ALL/ALLNOTRD)

slow_rnd_trigger
ZDC test: low rate (0.5hz) random triggere accompanied by 10hz calibration triggers

SPD_efficiency_inside_4BCs: study of PIT efficiency w.r.t. the SPD/ALICE clock shift SPD 4BCs 
notrigger:using 0AMU & bcmEMPTY -i.e. it won't deliver trigger (if 0AMU is 
very low)
test0PH0: single ALL cluster triggered by single class 0PH0

There is local instance test0PH0_B of PHYSICS_2.
It is triggered by 0PH0 in colliding bunches and can be
activated by going to:
http://alidcscom026.cern.ch
Local partition configurations:
-> PHYSICS_2 -> choose test0PH0 -> Submit

There is local instance testMUON_nomask of PHYSICS_2.
It is triggered by 0MSL (BC mask is NOT applied) and can be
activated by going to:
http://alidcscom026.cern.ch
Local partition configurations:
-> PHYSICS_2 -> choose testMUON_nomask -> Submit

When started in parallel with PHYSICS_1, 
rates in PHYSICS_1 partition should be monitored, and
decision taken in case these rates are affected...
