Information about accessible hardware
-------------------------------------
VALID.LTUS -ok
VALID.TRGINP
- contains a single line, with the names of the CTP inputs. If you
think it is necessary, additional information can be put (into this or
another file), describing to which detector each input belongs to. 
An example of VALID.TRGINP file:
T0 V0mb V0sc V0ce TRDpre ZDC1_l1 ZDC2_l1

Information about possible CTP configuration
--------------------------------------------
there is one more file: TRIGGER.DESC - 1 line describes 1
trigger descriptor - the symbolic name for 'physical trigger'.
First identifier in the line is the Trigger descriptor name 
followed by CTP inputs (from VALID.TRGINP file).
For example trigger descriptors with the names MB, SC, CE are
described by following lines in TRIGGER.DESC file:

MB T0 V0mb TRDpre ZDC1_l1
SC T0 V0sc TRDpre ZDC2_l1
CE T0 V0ce TRDpre ZDC3_l1

${PARTITION}.CLASSES should be called .CLUSTERS, because it
gives the list of clusters (for each cluster there are 2 lines)
belonging to that partition.
The format of the file:

TDS: MB SC
OUTPUT: HMPID TPC
TDS: CE SC
OUTPUT: TRD

Explanation: this file describes 2-cluster partition.
First cluster is triggered by MB or SC triggers and i
      it controls 2 detectors: HMPID and TPC.
Second cluster is taking CE or SC triggers, and it controls
      TRD detector.

Information about current CTP configuration
-------------------------------------------
This information is kept in ${PARTITION}.CURRCLASSES (again, more
adequate would be .CURRCLUSTERS).
The format is the same as for 'possible' configuration file. There
are so many .CURRCLUSTERS files, as many active partitions exists.
