BCMASKs handling:
---------------
Each possible BC mask is defined in file
$VMECFDIR/CFG/ctp/DB/VALID.BCMASKS.
There is 1 line per BC mask definition:
bcmaskname definition

where
bcmaskname: any identifier (for example: septemberBunch)
definition: the definition using 'H' for 1 'L' for 0 in the mask bit.
Each mask bit can be preceeeded by decimal number defining
the repetition of the bit. Brackets '(' ')' can be used for
creating repetitive groups of bits. Examples:
definition         BC mask
HL2H               1011
2(4HL3(HHL))       11110110110110 11110110110110
See vmeb/txtproc.py bcm2bits() method -
Lines starting with '#' are comments.

PF protection handling
----------------------
Similar approach is used for PF protection circuits.
There are max. 4 (PF1-4), PF circuits used/defined for 1 partition.
In VALID.PFS there are lines defining possible PF definitions:
PFname definition

where PFname is any identifier (example: spdpf). The definition
consists of 10 decimal/hexadecimal numbers:

spdpf 0xa 0x0 0x0 1 63 63 63 4 4 0x02


To do:
-----
1. partition editor
-------------------
parted.py:
Four buttons, named BCmask1,...,BCmask4 in Shared resources window.
Each button gives the choices defined in file VALID.BCMASKS.
User can choose, through these buttons, up to 4 BC masks used
in current partition.
In Class window, it is possible to choose 1 of 4 BCmask
defined in Shared resources window. Error is issued, if
BCmaskX is referenced, but not defined.

.partition file:
At the beginning of the file, there are lines defining BC masks
(if they are used in current partition):
BCM* name 

where:
* is 1,2,3 or 4
name is the name used in VALID.BCMASKS file for this mask.

Similarly, for PF protection circuits: if PF circuit is used,
its definition appears as:
PF* name

According to this, following methods should be modified in parted.py:
TrgSHR.setValue()  -BCmask definition has name in addition now
TrgSHR.getValue()
TrgPartition.loadfile()
TrgPartition.save()
TrgPartition.savercfg() -the message received from ctp_proxy
  will be changed

In .pcfg file (this file is only created, not modified by parted.py)
the following line has to be present if at least 1 BC mask is
referenced in current partition:
BCMASKS ABC...
ABC... are 3564 characters long string consisting of hexadecimal digits
(0,1,2,...,E,F). Each character contains the definition of 4 bits
in 4 masks. E.g. B means 'BC masked -i.e. vetoed' for BCM1, BCM2 and BCM4.

2. ctp_proxy
------------
- reading .pcfg file, BCmasks and PFs handling -allocation of right
 BCmask/PF and sending this information to pydimserver
- the message sent to pydimserver (in order to create .rcfg)
 will be changed:
 8 numbers, defining the allocation of logical to physical
 BCmasks/PFs, will be added
