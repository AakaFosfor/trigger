Hi all,
Thank you for the code. I took dim,smi,TRG,ECS tars from
/afs/cern.ch/user/j/jcmarin/public/InstallHMPID directory,
and unpacked them in 
~jusko1/public/ECS_ROOT (ECS, TRG) and in
~juskoa/public/ECS_ROOT (dim, smi)

I succeeded to start start_triggerDomain.sh, tpa.sh,start_trg_hi.sh.
There is ~jusko1/public/ECS_ROOT/setenvvar.csh and README to
start the whole thing (without PCA so far).
More about that later, now I only want to write about the files
used for 'information exchange' between ECS and trigger sw.

VALID.LTUS   -the list of valid detector names
VALID.TRGINP -the list of valid detectors contributing to
              CTP inputs (should be subset of VALID.LTUS)

${PARTITION}.CLASSES 
-represents 'intended' partition (i.e. there can be hundreds of them)
${PARTITION}.CURRCLASSES 
-represents 'active' partition, i.e. max. 6 of such files can exists
 in any time in ECS_ROOT/TRG directory.

Question1: would not it be enough, to have in these files
(.CLASSES, .CURRCLASSES) only 2 lines:
INPUT and OUTPUT ? I.e. ECS would know only about conributing/controlled
detectors for each partition and it doesn't take care about their
division among the classes,clusters- it is under the responsibility
of trigger software. In this case file ${PARTITION}.TRGINP file
is not necessary.
If yes, we should probably call them .PARTITION .CURRPARTITION.
I prepared first version of class_editor - try it on lxplus by starting 
cd ~jusko1/public/ECS_ROOT/TRG/
./trgdbed.py
From the user point of view, it uses Trigger descriptors as
'input' -they are described in file TRIGGER.DESCRIPTORS and 
represent 'physical triggers'(see Tab4.2 in TDR) and 
LTUs (VALID.LTUS) as 'output'.

Question2: The poposal of the communication between ECS 
and trigger software (comment please if I am wrong):
1. User creates partition description with class_editor, which
   creates some files in ECS_ROOT/TRG/partitionDB  directory.
   Among these files there will be ${PARTITION}.CLASSES file which
   is the input for ECS (it is not used as the input by trigger sw).
2. User asks ECS for the activation of partition PARTITION 
3. ECS starts tpa.sh which takes as input ${PARTITION}.CLASSES file
   and creates corresponding .smipp file, compiles it, and starts
   ${PARTITION}_TRG domain with TPA, TPA_SERVER objects
4. ECS issues START command to ${PARTITION}_TRG::TPA object.
   TRIGGER::CTP-proxy is invoked by this action to modify
   the CTP configuration.
5. From now, the following TPA states are checked by ECS:
   - RUNNING (ok, partition was loaded, and receives triggers)
   - READYTOSTART -intermediate step, which means that
     partition is not loaded, but files used as input for
     ECS were already created for this partition 
     ${PARTITION}.CURRCLASSES,${PARTITION}.TRGINP for now, 
     probably more files in future.
   - STOPPED -load was not successful -error message was sent
     through TPA_MESSAGE object (not clear to me now what does it
     mean, but I will learn later)

Bye, Anton
