start stops triggers by  DAQ_BUSY
To be used together with readttc
startttc: TTCit
To be ysed with ctpstart

and start/stop triggers by DAQ_BUSY

ltuttcit:
boards: ltu+ttcit
Check trigger sequence in TTCit generated by LTU.
Assumes that LTU is already programmed
and start/stop triggers by start/stop emulation

ltuSerialVsTTC:

generL1:
boards: CTP (L1,L2)

l0l1l2:
boards: CTP
not finished, goal was to test data on the l0-l1-l2 path.

gener:
boards: CTP(FO)
Generates pattern (outgen) on all FO in crate.
Dont remeber purpose.

ltuda:
