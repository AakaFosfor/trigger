This is directory for CTP subroutines used in more packages. They
are compiled separately (1 subroutine -> 1 .c file), and then
linked into ctplib.a library.
Steps to be done:
1. move subroutine from ctp/ctp.c into separate file in ctplib
   (i.e. it should be erased from ctp.c file)
2. modify linking for ctp.exe (in vme/ctp directory) to link
   ctplib.a
3. ctplib.a can be used from other packages (e.g. ctp_proxy).
   Step by step, it will grow by:
   - moving subroutines from ctp/ctp.c
   - writing new subroutines

vmeb/vmeai.make modified: -Lctplib -lctp
moved subroutines:

gcc -c -I../../../vmeb readBIC.c 
[aj@localhost ctplib]$ ar r libctp.a readBIC.o
ar: creating libctp.a
[aj@localhost ctplib]$ ar t libctp.a
